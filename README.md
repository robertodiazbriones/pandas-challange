# Pandas-challange
Pandas homework corresponds to the 4th unit of the _Data Analisis bootcamp course_, on this homework we were assign to analize a set of data **HeroesOfPymoli_purchase_data.csv** using python scripting thru Jupyter Notebook with the Pandas library. 

Heroes of Pymoli is an online game with great success in the gaming universe, from the file provided it was required to get the next analysis. 

- Player Count. 
- Purchasing Analysis (Total). 
- Gender Demographics. 
- Purchasing Analysis (Gender). 
- Age Demographics. 
- Purchasing Analysis (Age). 
- Top Spenders. 
- Most Popular Items. 
- Most Profitable Items. 

## Analysis conclusions

From above analisis I got to the next conclusions. 

1. 84% of the people that bought Heroes of Pymoli is male. 
2. Around 45% of players of HoP is between 20-24 years old. 
3. "Final Critic" is the most item purchased. 

## What I learnt

Besides IDEs, web notebooks provide and friendly and powerfull tool to develop scripting, on this challange we have the oportunity to interact with **Jupyter Notebook**, its live programming makes easer to find bugs on the scripting and the output interface give us rapid feedback of what we are doing and if we are on the right path. 

Pandas library helps data analisis trhu **Data Frame** building, once the data is in a data frame reshaping, data pivoting and data manipulation to get to the answers is really easy, the amount of methods and attributes that can be apply to Data Frames is huge, find different methods to get to the same point was another thing that I learnt in this challange.
