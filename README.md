## What I learnt

On this homework had the chance to interact with the buitl-in _csv_ library and get to know how to use the _**reader**_ method, I tried to keep my solution as simple as posible using conditionals, loops, lists and dictionaries. I think my solution is simple, easy to understand and the best is that it works :raised_hands:.   

Besides practice with python scripting more, on this homework I challenged myself to get a full understanding of how to commit changes of my project on github thru gitbash and use the _markdown sintaxis_ to edit the readme on git hub :blush: and as it can be seen how to insert emojis :laughing:.
